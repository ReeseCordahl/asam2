#When working with asam2, a couple of things were needed in order for the software to run properly. 
#1st: I needed to download each protein from RCSB as a .pdb file and remove any solvent or not polymer items from the .pdb file in pymol
#2nd: Create a new directory in my Home Directory with all of the protein files
#3rd: Similar to my work with BioEmu, I was working within the gateway node and will need to enter a true node to be able to run the sequences properly
#4th: I needed to get access to a GPU to run the sequences effectively. Unfourtunately, the GPU's were down at the time, therefore delaying results
#5th: As well as acessing a GPU, I needed to enter a Conda environment to run the system.
#6th: I then was able to follow the directions provided by asam2, specifying correct files and output directories
#Here are important specific codes when running asam2 (Example for the RIXI sequence):

# cd asam2

  salloc --gres=gpu:1 --mem=64G --time=01:00:00

  module purge

  module load Miniforge3

  conda create --name asamt

  conda activate asamt

  mkdir -p ~/asam2_outputs/rixi

  python3 scripts/generate_ensemble.py \
    -c config/atlas_model.yaml \
    -i ~/asam2_proteins/rixi_final.pdb \
    -o ~/asam2_outputs/rixi/rixi \
    -n 50 \
    -b 8 \
    -d cuda
