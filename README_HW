#When working with asam2, a couple of things were needed in order for the software to run properly. 
#First: I needed to download each protein from RCSB as a .pdb file and remove any solvent or not polymer items from the .pdb file in pymol
#Second: Create a new directory in my Home Directory with all of the protein files
#Third: I then was able to follow the directions provided by asam2, specifying correct files and output directories
